    <p>
      Classes are a way for us to define a blueprint for an object that we can
      then create instances of based off that blueprint so that the obejct will
      contain all the same properties and methods from the blueprint. Classes
      are very common in Object Oriented Programming and oop based languages.
      This is more of a syntax feature in JavaScript to enable us to define an
      object blueprint insetad of working with constructor functions.
