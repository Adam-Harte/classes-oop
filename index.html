    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>
      Classes are a way for us to define a blueprint for an object that we can
      then create instances of based off that blueprint so that the obejct will
      contain all the same properties and methods from the blueprint. Classes
      are very common in Object Oriented Programming and oop based languages.
      This is more of a syntax feature in JavaScript to enable us to define an
      object blueprint insetad of working with constructor functions.
    </p>
    <h3>Constructor Method</h3>
    <p>
      A constructor method alllows us to control the instantiation of
      classes/objects by passing in values to be assigned upon creation of the
      instance object. Constructor methods are created in classes by using the
      'constructor' key word and then declaring it like e method e.g.
      constructor() {}. All arguments in the constructor method can then be used
      to assign the values to the fields/properties of the class instance. We
      assign the values usng the this keyword as that this will be of the object
      you are creating so the this will be relatig to the properties of that
      specific object you are creating.
    </p>
    <h3>Fields</h3>
    <p>
      Fields are the properties of the class you define deemed as class fileds
      instead of properties as these fields only become actual object properties
      when you create objects by instantiating the class.
