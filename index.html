    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>
      Classes are a way for us to define a blueprint for an object that we can
      then create instances of based off that blueprint so that the obejct will
      contain all the same properties and methods from the blueprint. Classes
      are very common in Object Oriented Programming and oop based languages.
      This is more of a syntax feature in JavaScript to enable us to define an
      object blueprint insetad of working with constructor functions.
    </p>
    <h3>Constructor Method</h3>
    <p>
      A constructor method alllows us to control the instantiation of
      classes/objects by passing in values to be assigned upon creation of the
      instance object. Constructor methods are created in classes by using the
      'constructor' key word and then declaring it like e method e.g.
      constructor() {}. All arguments in the constructor method can then be used
      to assign the values to the fields/properties of the class instance. We
      assign the values usng the this keyword as that this will be of the object
      you are creating so the this will be relatig to the properties of that
      specific object you are creating.
    </p>
    <h3>Fields</h3>
    <p>
      Fields are the properties of the class you define deemed as class fileds
      instead of properties as these fields only become actual object properties
      when you create objects by instantiating the class.
    </p>
    <h3>This</h3>
    <p>
      The 'this' keyword can cause problems in objects and classes when trying
      to refer to properties especially when we are using events where the
      'this' context then refers to the html element emitting the event instead
      of the object/class itself. The solution is to bind the method to 'this'
      which in this case will refer to the object/class itself.
    </p>
    <button class="log-title">Log Title</button>
    <button class="log-artist">Log Artist</button>
    <h3>Static Methods and Fields</h3>
    <p>
      Static methods and fields allow us to define methods and fields which are
      solely accessible via the class itself and not object instances of the
      class. This is great for defining global methods/fields that you want to
      call anywherer without having to define an object instance.
    </p>
    <h3>Getters and Setters</h3>
    <p>
      Getters and Setter are used as ways to control how we read and write data
      in class object instances. We can use the get keyword to create a getter
      that controls how we access a property. We can use the set keyword to
      create a setter which controls how we assign values to a property.
    </p>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>
      Inheritance is a way of extending classes from another class so that it
      'inherits' all the properties and methods of that class. This is great to
      avoid code duplication and keep blocks of code together to be easily
      extendable and reusable. A quick note on constructors with inheritance, if
      you create a class that exteneds another without a constructor then that
      extended classes constructor will be called however if the class that is
      extending has a constrcutor then that constructor will be called. If you
      need to extend a class and have both constructors called you need to run
      the 'super' method in the extended classes constructor to call the base
      class constructor followed by your constructor logic.
